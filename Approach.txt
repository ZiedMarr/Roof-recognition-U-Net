-Chosen network architecture : 
	-I chose to use U-Net architecture based on the paper "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation" by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, Thomas Brox
	-reason : it is a commonly used and efficient architecture for semantic segmentation tasks

-Data set and augmentation : 
	-the offered dataset was relatively small. It could engender bad generalization. 
	-To minimize the risks of bad generalization, I used data augmentation to expand the dataset
